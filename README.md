# 🎶 Spotify Wrapped Analysis  

This project is my personal *Spotify Wrapped*, created by analyzing my streaming history data.  
I requested my data from Spotify, cleaned it, and generated insights into my top artists, songs, and listening habits.

## 📂 Project Structure  
- inputs/ → Raw JSON files from Spotify (music + podcasts)

- README.md → Project documentation

## 🚀 Steps  
1. Place your raw Spotify data (JSON files) in the *inputs/* folder.  
2. Run scripts/spotify_cleaned.py to clean and merge them into a CSV file.  
3. Use Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore and visualize the data.  
4. Generate your own Spotify Wrapped with charts and insights.
